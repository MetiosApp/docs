# Welcome to Metios

Metios is an embeddable survey platform designed for modern SaaS and web applications. It enables teams to create, customize, and embed surveys anywhere — on websites, in web apps, or within mobile views — and collect actionable feedback without writing a single line of code.

Built for developers, product managers, and marketers alike, Metios provides a lightweight yet powerful feedback engine that integrates seamlessly into any stack. Whether you're measuring customer satisfaction, collecting feature feedback, or tracking NPS, Metios gives you the insights you need to grow.

## Why Metios?

Traditional survey tools often require redirects, complex setup, or external links that disrupt user experience. Metios solves this by providing embeddable widgets and APIs that keep feedback collection native to your product experience.
